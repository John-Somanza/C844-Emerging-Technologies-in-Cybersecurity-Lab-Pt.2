<h1>TASK 2: WLAN AND MOBILE SECURITY PLAN</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

As wireless and mobile technologies continue to grow in presence and popularity, the world is becoming more and more connected. Unfortunately, this also means that devices and networks are becoming more and more vulnerable to outside threats. Businesses must identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities and threats in order to protect employees’ personal information and ensure the organization is secure from passive leaking of proprietary information.

In this task you will assume the role of an IT professional who is responsible for identifying wireless and mobile vulnerabilities, as outlined in the scenario below. You will then present your findings and recommend solutions to mitigate these risks and prevent future threats.

<h2>Task Walk-Through:</h2>

A. WLAN Vulnerabilities

First vulnerability for WLAN:

The first vulnerability for WLAN is the 3rd floor and how it is unoccupied. This can be used to create unauthorized access to the network through a rogue access point or evil twin with no one knowing.

Second vulnerability for WLAN:

The second vulnerability for WLAN is the back patio service area. This is a great place for attackers to try and access the network using by Metasploit, for example, to check for any vulnerabilities in order to exploit them.

B. Mobile Vulnerabilities

First vulnerability for Mobile devices:

The first vulnerability for mobile devices would be if they were to connect to Wi-Fi in a public area that potentially has been compromised. This is an issue due to the fact that they have account representatives who are on the road 80% of the time, which could lead to sensitive information being stolen from the mobile devices that they are using if they were to make this mistake.

Second vulnerability for Mobile devices:

The second vulnerability for mobile devices is if they were to get lost or stolen. Since the account representatives have company-issued devices, and employess follow a BYOD policy, there are plenty of opportunities for devices to get lost or stolen. With that in mind, if attackers were to gain possession of these devices, then they could potentially gain access to the company’s network and information without being detected.

C.  Mitigation

First Mitigation for WLAN:

The first mitigation for WLAN would be to check and see how important the patio access realy is. If it’s not that important, than it would be best to see how far the signal goes and try to reduce it so that it doesn’t go outside the premises. This will keep the Wi-Fi broadcast in the proximity and away from anyone outside the building, where attackers can be lurking, trying to find a signal to the Wi-Fi in order to try and break into it and the network.

Second Mitigation WLAN:

The second mitigation for WLAN is to makesure the 3rd floor is blocked or locked so no one with unauthorized access can enter, as well as checked for any unauthorized devices on the networking. The best way to perform this would be through a wireless survey, using a wireless detection system that will alert the IT department if any new devices go onto the network without permission.

First Mitigation for Mobile devices:

The first mitigation for mobile devices is for the account representatives to use a VPN whenever they are connecting to the company’s network outside of the building. This will ensure secure communication with the company’s network when using public Wi-Fi.

Second Mitigation for Mobile devices:

The second mitigation for mobile devices is to encrypt them. It is not uncommon for someone to lose their belongings in some way, shape, or form, so encrypting it will at least give a sense of security knowing that no one, attackers for example, can just pick up the device and see all the sensitive information.

D. Preventative Measures

Preventative Measure for WLAN:

A preventative measure that will increase the security posture of the WLAN would be to have WPA3 configured at the minimum, with WPA3-enterprise being the ideal encryption. Along with WPA3, we would obviously need to have password-protected access to the WLAN, and a strong password at that. A strong password typically consists of at least 1 capital letter, 1 number, 1 special character, and more than 10 characters.

Preventative Measure for Mobile environment:

A preventative measure that will increase the security posture of the mobile environment is to enfore an MDM (Mobile Device Management) policy. This would be installed on all mobile hardware in order for the IT department to respond to lost or stolen devices. With this software, the IT department will be able to locate, remote lock, and even data wipe a device remotely if needed.

Reference federal, state, or industry regulations that justify these measures:

A regulation to support these preventative measueres is the Sarbanes-Oxely Act (SOX). With this act, high accountability, authentication, and authorization is necessary for network access and data storage, especially since the company plans to go public soon. In regards to the company’s IT systems, the regulators will need to keep tabs on all of the metadata logs to see who logged in as well as when they logged out. Also they will need to keep track of any data and files that were changed, and which employees had what level of access to the systems. The SOX act in and of itself treis to reduce fraud and increase the accountability of the company in cases of complaints brought against them from other companies through NIST Role Based Access Control standards.

E.  Recommended BYOD Approach

First Recommendation:

The first recommendation I suggest is to once again implement an MDM system. For good reason, Alliah went ahead and enforced a BYOD approach for cost-saving reasons, but without an MDM system the cost towards the business could increase exponentially.

Second Recommendation:

The second recommendation I suggest is to ditch the BYOD approach and implement a COBO (Company Owned, Business Only) approach instead. All employees will end up having the same equipment purchased by the company. It will cost more money than the BYOD approach upfront, but the longterm investment will be worth it. Of course, if they are unable to do this, then they will need to go with the BYOD policy along with the MDM system. The policy should reference the latest NIST Standards Framework 1.1, https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.CSWP.04162018 (NIST April 2018).
